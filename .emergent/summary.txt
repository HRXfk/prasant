The previous AI engineer initiated the project by thoroughly analyzing the provided  for EcoWorth. They correctly identified the core value proposition and proposed the Real-time Value Calculator as the primary aha moment feature for the MVP. A phased development plan was outlined, prioritizing this calculator. The engineer then posed critical clarifying questions to the user regarding data sources, geographic focus, calculation complexity, and external integrations, demonstrating adherence to the prompt's instruction to confirm plans and gather necessary information before proceeding. No code has been written or modified yet; the current state is one of planning and awaiting user input.

The EcoWorth application is envisioned as a dynamic web platform to visualize, calculate, and educate users about the economic and social value of ecosystem services in specific regions. The core problem it aims to solve is making the abstract value of nature tangible through monetary valuation.

Key features include:
- **Interactive Ecosystem Valuation Map:** Allows region selection to display carbon sequestration, pollination, water purification, soil fertility, and recreational values.
- **Real-time Value Calculator:** Estimates annual monetary value of ecosystem services based on user-inputted land area, ecosystem type, and current land use, providing results in INR/USD. This feature was identified as the MVP.
- **Case Studies Section:** Showcases real-world examples of policy impact from ecosystem valuations.
- **Citizen Scientist Uploads:** Enables community-powered data contribution through photos and biodiversity information.
- **What If? Simulator:** Demonstrates environmental and economic loss from ecosystem degradation.

Educational content covers what ecosystem services are, their types (provisioning, regulating, cultural, supporting), and valuation methodologies (market-based, non-market, replacement cost). The target audience includes students, researchers, NGOs, policymakers, farmers, local communities, and the eco-conscious public. The current implementation only involves initial planning.

<code_architecture>
The application follows a standard full-stack project structure, with a distinct separation between the frontend and other project concerns.



**Detailed Directory Structure:**
- : The root directory of the application.
- : Contains all React application code and configuration.
    - : Manages Node.js dependencies and project scripts. Important for defining required packages and ensuring consistent versions (e.g., React, Tailwind CSS dependencies).
    - : Configuration file for Tailwind CSS, allowing custom styling, themes, and plugins. Essential for defining the application's visual design system.
    - : PostCSS configuration, often used with Tailwind CSS for processing CSS.
    - : Stores environment variables, critically including  for backend API communication. This file is protected from direct modification by the AI engineer.
    - : Contains static assets like  and other public resources.
    - : The core source code directory for the React application.
        - : The entry point of the React application, responsible for rendering the main  component into the DOM.
        - : The main React component, where the primary application logic and UI will reside. This file is targeted for initial bulk writing.
        - : Component-specific CSS styles, likely to be populated with Tailwind CSS directives and custom styles for .
        - : Global CSS styles applied across the application.

No modifications have been made to these files yet. The structure represents the initial setup provided to the AI engineer.

<current_work>
The AI engineer has completed the initial project analysis and planning phase for the EcoWorth application. Based on the provided , the Real-time Value Calculator has been identified as the core feature to deliver the aha moment and will be the focus of the Minimum Viable Product (MVP).

A detailed three-phase development plan has been proposed:
1.  **Phase 1 (Core Value Calculator):** This MVP includes building a beautiful landing page, an interactive calculator with inputs for land area, ecosystem type, land use, and region, and a display of results for various ecosystem services (carbon sequestration, pollination, water purification, soil fertility, recreation/ecotourism) along with total annual values in INR and USD.
2.  **Phase 2 (Educational Enhancement):** Features like the What If? Simulator, educational content, and case studies.
3.  **Phase 3 (Advanced Features):** Interactive map integration and citizen science upload.

Currently, no code has been written or modified. The AI engineer has asked the user four crucial clarifying questions regarding data sources for valuation, geographic focus, desired complexity of calculations, and preferences for external integrations (mapping, currency conversion). The development is paused, awaiting these key decisions from the user to ensure alignment before proceeding with implementation.
